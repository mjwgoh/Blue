# Blue: A Dementia Patient Assistant

## Introduction

Blue is a dedicated digital assistant aimed at enhancing the quality of life for individuals living with dementia. By leveraging intuitive technology, Blue seeks to empower users with dementia to maintain a level of independence, providing them with tools to manage daily tasks, ensure their safety, and support their memory. 

During testing, it became clear that dementia patients frequently forgot to take their mobile devices with them, undermining the app's real-world effectiveness. This revelation prompted a reassessment of the project's viability, ultimately leading to the suspension of further development.
